# About

Factory builder game about constructing Dyson Sphere. Get raw materials from rocket landing pads and route them through your factory with the only goal in mind - to produce enough energy to warp back home. Created specifically for GMTK Game Jam 2024.

# Controls
The game can be beaten with mouse only but you can also use WASD/Arrows to move camera or press Escape key to dismiss stuff.

# Inspiration
The game is hugely inspired by Factorio's Space Exploration mod but has a unique twist as items must be transported only using Gravity Pistons.
